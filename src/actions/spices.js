        "introduction": "For many people in countries where quality ice cream is readily available, vanilla is the most popular of the non-pungent spices. It has been regarded as one of the most expensive spices along with saffron, cardamon and green peppercorns. The cost of vanilla reflects its historic importance as a flavor used in the royal drinks of the Mayans and Aztecs that were based on chocolate. The Aztecs called vanilla tlilxochitl, and they used it with chile peppers to flavor their drink.<br>Vanilla is found in the seeds of the orchid vine, Vanilla planifolia (V. fragrans), which is native to Mexico. The Spaniards likened the bean pods to a little sheath or vaina, which is derived from the similar Latin word, vagina! Obtaining the flavor can be a several month long process, resulting from slowly fermenting the beans, which contain many small seeds; the ground-up bean is then used in similar fashion to coffee. People who enjoy the strong vanilla taste want to use freshly cured bean, while others accept the commercial extract. True vanilla in ice cream contains tiny dark flecks resulting from the presence of the seeds. However, the vanilla flavor, which is mainly due to vanillin, can be readily chemically synthesized from eugenol or guaiacol, or from lignin derived from tar, wood, or tonka beans. This product lacks the quality of the natural vanilla flavor that develops during the curing of the best beans when glucosides are converted to vanillic aldehyde, which is vanillin, since other aromatic chemicals are also produced.<br>Vanilla trees are grown in Mexico, Central America (Guatemala and especially Costa Rica), and in some Caribbean islands (especially Jamaica). However, it is difficult to grow since it is only pollinated by native bees and hummingbirds. It requires artificial fertilization outside its natural habitat, but it can be cultivated through the use of cuttings. Following its introduction to the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean, a method of hand pollination was introduced in 1841. Reunion is still an important site of vanilla production; the variety is called Bourbon vanilla, after the former name of the island. Madagascar is now the major producer of Bourbon vanilla.<br>When vanilla became popular in 17th century Europe, it was used for many indications, varying from stomach ulcers to sedation. As was the case with many spices, it was extolled as an aphrodisiac. Today, it may fulfill its latter function when used in high quality baked goods, confectionary and desserts, although most users regard it more prosaically as a delicious flavor that may help digestion. Vanilla is used to flavor tobacco and as a fragrance in the cosmetic industry. It is of interest that sensitive workers in the vanilla industry may develop vanillism, resulting in headaches and skin rashes.<br>Artificial vanilla (containing vanillin and ethylvanillin) is acceptable to most tastes, and therefore the export of true vanilla may continue to decline, since the culture and manufacture of the quality product is expensive and relatively non-competitive. Moreover, its value as an exotic medicine is no longer accepted. Thus the role of the vanilla bean has declined in significance, with over 95% of the world’s supply of vanilla flavor being synthetic.",
        "usefulParts": "The cured, dried fruits of the plant impart the flavor.",
        "medicalProperties": "Vanillin is in the class of vanilloids, that includes – surprisingly – capsaicin (8-methy-N-vanillyl noneamide) from chile pepper and eugenol from cloves, cinnamon and other spices, and zingerone from ginger. The vanilloid receptors of the central and peripheral nervous systems bind with these compounds, resulting in different sensory effects. Thus, capsaicin can cause a burning sensation while eugenol results in mild anesthesia; vanillin itself is neutral.",
        "historicalView": "Vanilla is an aromatic stimulant, with a tendency towards the nervous system. It has also been regarded as an aphrodisiac. It has been employed as a remedy in hysteria, low fevers, impotency, etc. But its use as a medicine is obsolete in this country, although still sometimes employed on the Continent and elsewhere.",

The plant is now cultivated in India, Iran and several Mediterranean countries; it used to be grown in the southern England town, Saffron Walden. The yellow color of paella, bouillabaise, saffron cakes, challah bread, and some curry sauces is characteristically obtained from saffron. Unlike the cheaper turmeric, it can penetrate into rice grains, and a small amount can impart its flavor and smell to the food. Currently, saffron is one of the most expensive spices because it requires labor-intensive harvesting. The medicinal uses of saffron in the past included its general employment as an antidote against poisoning, a digestant, an aphrodisiac, a tonic, and as a specific for dysentery and measles. In accordance with the Doctrine of Signatures, its yellow color signified its natural ability to treat jaundice.",
        "usefulParts": "The flower’s triple stigma, and the adjacent part of the style yield the spice.",

        "introduction": "Several spices have been called anise. The native of Egypt, Pimpinella anisum, is anise seed or aniseed, while China is the source of Illicum verum, star anise. In the past, dill, caraway and fennel seeds were confused with anise seed.",
        "usefulParts": "The seeds have been used widely in cooking, and are popular in spicy cakes. The “oil of anise” is often used in artificial licorice, and gives its distinctive taste to liqueurs such as anisette and raki. Anise is used in many processed foods and in cough medicines, and is often included in pet foods for the flavor it imparts.",
        "medicalProperties": "Over the centuries, anise has been reported to have numerous medical benefits, but there is no evidence that it offers any pharmacologic benefit. It is thus a flavorful digestive spice that may be soothing, stimulating or carminative (relieving gas) in different individuals, and it is a popular taste in drinks, confections and simple proprietary medicines.",
        "historicalView": "Oil of anise possesses the same aromatic, carminative, and stimulant properties as anise fruits, and as already noticed is commonly preferred to them as a medicine, and is alone official in the British Pharmacopoeia.",

Most black pepper comes from India, where it is known as the king of the spices; it is also exported from Indonesia, Malaysia and Brazil. It has always been one of the most popular spices, and the successful sea voyages of U.S. importers of pepper and cloves made Salem, Massachusetts, one of the richest towns in the U.S.A. at the beginning of the 19th century. Black pepper is available on most Western dining tables, but yellow pepper is preferred in cooking since it does not add dark color to foods.",

        "introduction": "Several varieties of seed plants are known as cardamon, but the best known is an export from India, where it is obtained from a ginger-like plant, Elettaria cardamomum. It is related to black cardamom, and to melegueta (also known as grains of paradise), a peppery cardamon-like seed which grows mainly in West Africa; this was a popular European import in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Cardamom is particularly popular in Arab countries for flavoring coffee, and perhaps half the world’s production is thus used. Cardamom and related spices were used by the Romans, and it remains popular in baked products in Scandinavian and Baltic countries. The seeds are widely used in cooking and in chewing products (similar to chewing gum) in India and Pakistan, and in Persian cuisine, but it is not widely appreciated in North America as a cooking spice or as a flavor in candies or beverages. Its exotic qualities have suggested it could be used as a stimulant and aphrodisiac, and long ago it was used as a perfume and breath freshener.",
        "usefulParts": "The aromatic extract contains many essential oil chemicals, some of which have a smell like that of camphor. Thus, its main use is as an adjunctive spice in curries, coffees and other Asian or Middle Eastern foods. It used to be second in expense to saffron, and is known in India as Queen of Spices. However, declining markets and increased production in Guatemala have led to a fall in its value.",
        "medicalProperties": "Medically, it is used mainly as a flavor and an aid to digestion. It is used more prosaically to treat colds, bronchitis, fevers, inflammatory conditions of the oropharynx, and liver complaints. There is no evidence to support any of these uses.",
        "historicalView": "The effects of cardamoms are those of a very agreeable aromatic; they are used partly on account of their flavour, and partly for their carminative and stimulant properties. They are, however, rarely prescribed alone, but commonly either as adjuvants or correctives of cordial, tonic and purgative medicines.",

The bark is coarser than that of true cinnamon, and the taste is more astringent and harsh, although a variety C. burmannii from Indonesia is similar to the Sri Lanka product. Cassia is more widely used today than is cinnamon, although most people are unfamiliar with the name cassia; moreover, the word can be confused with Cassia angustifolia – a very different plant, namely senna! Cassia as a spice is favored by the Chinese for incorporation in Five Spice Powder (along with Szechuan pepper, cloves, fennel and star anise). Cassia leaves (tejpat) are currently used as a spice in Indian cooking, while cassia leaves and buds were a favored import (with the name malabathrum) in ancient Rome and also during the Middle Ages.",
        "usefulParts": "The spice in the case of both cinnamon and cassia come from bark of the plants.",
        "medicalProperties": "Cinnamon and cassia extracts have been used medically to treat gastrointestinal problems and as a specific for diarrhea, but their value is marginal.

        "introduction": "Chile peppers or Capsicums, come in so many cultivated varieties (cultivars) that the shape, color, taste and pungency of any one species can vary considerably over time or according to the country from which it is obtained. Their pungency is caused by capsaicin and other capsaicinoids, which belong to the vanilloid family of chemicals. They are native to Central and South America (where they are called aji), and may have originated in Bolivia; currently, they are grown in many tropical countries as well as in the more temperate climates of the Southwest United States and in the Mediterranean area. In the U.S., as in many countries, they are often used for decoration. The name chile is said to be derived from a Nahuatl word, tchili, meaning red (whereas the name Chile, the country, is derived from a word meaning snow). <br> Chile peppers are broadly subdivided into variants of Capsicum annuum and C. frutescens. The main cultivars of C. annuum range from the non-pungent bell pepper and Hungarian paprika varieties to the very hot-tasting wild bird pepper or chiltepin. The latter is of interest in that it appeals to birds, who apparently do not experience the burning quality of the fruit, whereas all other animals (except, perhaps, rats) are repelled by this quality. The important cultivars of C. frutescens and its sub-varieties include the most pungent peppers, habañero and Scot’s Bonnet; the less fiery jalapeño, cayenne, Tabasco and many exotic cultivars; and the milder New Mexican (or Anaheim), Serrano, ancho (poblano) and pasilla. Chili, salsa, and other forms of prepared peppers and cayenne peppers are sold in a large variety of products of varying pungency. Ornamental peppers are popular because of their color and their ethnic attractiveness, and make pleasant decorative souvenirs of visits to exotic places, as are the colorful stringed ristras of dried New Mexico peppers. In California, increasing numbers of people are developing a taste for different types of chile peppers and flavors in condiments and spicy recipes, and even in candies. ",
        "usefulParts": "The fruit of the plant contain all the heat and taste.",
        "medicalProperties": "Fresh or lightly cooked peppers are rich in Vitamin C; indeed this was first isolated in Hungary from bell pepper. However, these peppers are best known in medicine as sources of capsaicin which is used as an investigatory tool (since it stimulates liberation of Substance P, and is relied on as a cough inducing agent in laboratory studies) as well as a pain relieving medication for topical use in arthritis and neuropathies. Peppers which have pungency increase mucous secretion in the lungs and nose. The capsaicin of chile peppers is also used offensively in pepper sprays since it is very irritating to the eyes and respiratory tract. Most of the older medical uses (such as dyspepsia) are not regarded as valid medications, but chile pepper is still used in Ayurvedic therapy to treat peptic ulcers. Currently, capsaicin is used topically in proprietary creams to treat pain and neuropathies, whereas formerly chile-impregnated plasters and poultices were similarly used. The addition of chile pepper to chicken soup (with accompanying garlic and other herbs) is recommended as a useful therapy for colds, sinusitis and bronchitis.",
        "historicalView": "When taken internally, capsicum is a powerful stimulant producing when swallowed in small doses, a sensation of warmth in the stomach, and a general glow over the whole body; hence in moderation it is very useful as a condiment, for which both it and cayenne pepper are very extensively employed, and more especially in tropical countries where vegetable food is chiefly consumed. Taken in this way, it promotes digestion, and prevents flatulence. It is also sometimes give medicinally, as a general stimulant, in atonic dyspepsia, in diarrhea arising from putrid or undigested matter in the stomach, in extreme prostration, in poisoning by opium, in paralytic affections, and in delirium tremens, in which disease when taken early it is said sometimes to produce sleep.",

        "introduction": "Although not often considered to be a spice, the seeds of the Theobroma cacao tree deserve to be thought of as an exotic, aromatic, flavor with medicinal values, i.e. as a spice. It originated in the Yucatan area of Mexico, and it was used as a hot drink by the Maya and as a cold, sweetened drink by the Aztecs. Linnaeus chose to call the chocolate tree Theobroma, meaning “food of the gods”, since it was used as an offering by the Maya and Aztecs in their religious ceremonies. The word “cacao” is from the Mayan, ka-ka-io; the word chocolate comes from Mayan “chocol” (hot) and Nahuatl “alt” (water) implying that the chocolate content of the bean was extracted by hot water.<br>The Spanish brought chocolate beans to Europe in 1544, but the original criollo cacao trees have since been replaced by a variety of the tree called forastero; this has resulted in a blander form of chocolate which now comes from many parts of the world, including West Africa. The harvesting of cocoa pods in some African countries has become notorious, since it is based essentially on slave labor. Over the centuries and in different countries, chocolate has been enjoyed in many different forms and flavors. The Mayans added vanilla and chile to it, and this exists today as mole. Allspice, annatto, cinnamon, mace and other spices have been added to this sauce; less popular were combinations including ambergris (a secretion of sperm whales), musk, jasmine, lemon peel and so on. Sweetening with honey or sugar and the addition of milk made chocolate drinks and confections more addictive.<br>At one time, chocolate houses were as popular in Europe as coffee houses have become in the U.S.A. Schivelbusch comments that coffee was a “Protestant, northern drink” while chocolate was its “Catholic, southern counterpart”. However, as chocolate and cocoa spread from the aristocratic courts of Spain to become a more mundane drink in France, it became a more social, Bohemian, non-alcoholic alternative social drink in England and other northern countries. Eventually, the chocolaty drink, cocoa, declined in importance as it became a beverage directed at children, as an alternative to tea and coffee. Nevertheless, countries such as Switzerland and Belgium produced famous varieties of chocolate confections that appeal to ordinary and sophisticated consumers who accept that their delight in the product is a mild addiction, based on the sweetness and the deliciousness of the manufactured product. Surely, this makes the chocolate seed a spice, equal to spicy flavors such as vanilla and cinnamon. ",
        "usefulParts": "All cocoa beans are fermented, dried, roasted, crushed into nibs or pieces, then further ground into a liquid mass usually containing 50% cocoa butter.",
        "medicalProperties": "The theobromine content may stimulate the brain, since it is an xanithine similar to coffee. Recently, the polyphenols in chocolate have been generously praised as being potent anti-oxidants that may prevent degenerative diseases, thus reducing the guilt sensations of chocaholics. However, true medicinal values have not been established for pure chocolate.",
        "historicalView": "Cacao butter has been but lately introduced into the British and United States pharmocopoeias, but it has been long used on the Continent. It is peculiarly well adapted from its consistency, blandness, and freedom from rancidity, for the preparation of suppositories for which purpose it is official. It is also used as a basis for pessaries, as an ingredient in cosmetic ointments, and for coating pills and other purposes.",

        "introduction": "Cinnamon is usually regarded as the bark of the Cinnamomum zeylanicum tree; it is known as canela in Portugal and Spain, cannelle in France, and Zimt in Germany. In India and Iran, it is called darchini, meaning “wood from China”, which more accurately describes cassia. The original name came from the Malay word, “kayumanis”, meaning sweet wood. The Hebrew equivalent was “qinnämön”, and this is the source of the word cinnamon. The word canella was used by the Italians to describe as “little cannon tubes” that the rolled up quills of bark resembled. The cinnamon (or cassia) trade was controlled by Venice in the 13th and 14th centuries, and resulted in the city becoming very wealthy.<br>The Egyptians used cinnamon and cassia along with myrrh in embalming, perhaps because cinnamic acid (and also myrrh) has antibacterial effects. The Hebrews, and others, used cinnamon and cassia in religious ceremonies, while in Mexico, Asiatic countries, Arabia and North Africa it was valued in cooking. The Roman empire imported huge amounts of cinnamon, and it may have been used mostly in perfumes and fragrances and to flavor wines, but it was not favored as a cooking spice. In the Middle Ages and subsequently, cinnamon, was imported from Egypt, having been brought there by Arabian traders who obtained it in Ceylon. It became a favorite flavor in many banquet foods and was regarded as an appetite stimulator, a digestive, an aphrodisiac, and a treatment for coughs and sore throats. Currently, in America cinnamon is mainly used to flavor desserts and condiment, while powder and quills (which may be cassia) are fashionable components of expensive drinks of coffee. True cinnamon is very popular in Mexican cooking and in coffee and tea.<br>It is probable that Egyptian cinnamon in Pharaonic times was mainly cassia, much of which came from China where large groves of trees grew around the city of Kweilin (now called Guilin): “kwei” means cinnamon, and “lin” means forest. The true cinnamon of Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka) was “discovered” by the Portuguese in the early 16th century, who thenceforth controlled the trade with great cruelty. An increasing demand for cinnamon led to the Dutch fighting the Portuguese, and in the mid-17th century Ceylon’s cinnamon trade was taken over and controlled by Holland. In the 18th century, many Dutch were massacred in Sri Lanka in an effort to break the cruel rule of the new colonialists, but this led to reprisals and a subsequent growth in Portuguese control of the island’s cinnamon plantations. The Dutch forcefully monopolized cinnamon; to keep up prices in 1760, they burnt huge amounts in Amsterdam to create a shortage. Perhaps this hostile act convinced cinnamon fanciers in other countries that the spice was being over-utilized in gourmet cooking.<br>Nevertheless, in 1795, the English seized control of Ceylon hoping to revive interest in cinnamon. Before long, however, cinnamon saplings were transplanted by the Dutch for cultivation in Indonesia and by the French to plantations in Mauritius, Reunion and Guyana. The importance of cinnamon from Ceylon continued to gradually decline as this spice became less fashionable in cooking and in wine making. It is of interest that cinnamon now grows in Egypt, where in the 19th century, it was introduced by the French who planted saplings that had been grown in the Jardin des Plantes of Paris. However, after that time the importance of cinnamon in French cooking waned, whereas it still persists in traditional recipes of French Canada.<br>Currently, cinnamon is regarded as a wonderful aroma in baked goods, but its taste is of limited appeal. Similarly, it is not greatly favored as a medication or as a food preserver or as an incense. In view of its huge popularity and the enormous struggles involved in its trade over the past millennium, this ancient spice undoubtedly merits greater appreciation today. ",
        "usefulParts": "The spice in the case of both cinnamon and cassia come from bark of the plants.",
        "medicalProperties": "Cinnamon and cassia extracts have been used medically to treat gastrointestinal problems and as a specific for diarrhea, but their value is marginal. Their use as antimicrobials is of limited relevance, and is dubious of the presence of cinnamon or cassia in cooked foods retards spoilage if left unrefrigerated in a tropical climate. Nevertheless, cinnamon along with many other spices has antibacterial properties that may be worth exploiting.",
        "historicalView": "Cinnamon bark has generally the properties of the spices, being aromatic, carminative, and stimulant. It is also somewhat astringent. It is rarely prescribed alone, but chiefly as an addition to tother medicines, to improve their flavour or to check their griping qualities. As a cordial, stimulant, and tonic, it is indicated in all cases characterized by feebleness and atony. As an astringent it is employed in diarrhea, usually in combination with chalk, the vegetable infusions, or opium.",

        "introduction": "The history of cloves is similar to that of nutmeg and mace. The clove tree (Syzgium aromaticum, or Eugenia caryophyllis) is also indigenous to the Moluccas, and they were probably imported from the Spice Islands into China more than 2000 years ago. From the 8th century, cloves became increasingly popular in Europe, and along with nutmeg, the importation of this coveted spice helped the enterprising Venetians become extraordinarily wealthy. The lure of cloves and nutmeg attracted the Portuguese to the Spice Islands in 1514; they were followed by the Dutch in 1605, and they retained control over the trade until late in the 18th century, at which time the exotic spices of the Moluccas were starting to be grown elsewhere in the world, and they lost their incredible attraction. Currently, clove trees are grown in such places as Zanzibar, Madagascar and Mauritius, as well as in Ternate, Tidore and a couple of other of the northern Spice Islands and in Indonesia. Cloves are used in kreteks; these crackly, aromatic cigarettes are favored by Indonesians to such a degree that the country has to import cloves from Africa to supplement its own indigenous crop.<br>The word clove comes from the Latin word clavus, meaning nail, since the shaft and head of the clove bud resembles a nail. It is used to flavor meats, including ham, and is incorporated in Indian curries and rice dishes such as vindaloo; it is used in pickles and sauces (e.g. Worcestershire sauce) and some European spice cakes. However, its value as a flavor has declined considerably since the time of Magellan. It should be remembered that Magellan’s fateful circumnavigation of the world (1519-1522) started off with five ships and over 250 men. Although only one ship and 18 men returned to Spain, nevertheless its cargo of about 50 tons of cloves and nutmeg were considered to have made the expedition a financial success. Cloves and nutmeg were among the most precious of items of Europe of the 16th and 17th centuries, and they were worth more than their weight in gold.<br>Fortunes were made in the East Indian and Spice Island trade, since precious spices brought huge rewards to successful importers. The glittering wealth of the Portuguese and Spanish courts, of Italian port cities, Dutch trading firms, German bankers and British speculators was followed by the extraordinarily successful entry in 1672 of the United States into the spice trade. Competitive sailing boats helped make Salem the capital of spices in the first half of the 19th century. A certain Elihu Yale, who was born in 1649 in Boston, made his fortune as a spice merchant in India; he gave material support from his family home in Wales to help build up the institution that was to become Yale University. This is, interestingly, located in Connecticut, which was nicknamed the Nutmeg State, since enterprising merchants were able to sell fake nutmegs made of wood to unsuspecting purchasers who valued the spice. ",
        "usefulParts": "The clove of commerce is the dried unexpanded flower. The principle constituent of cloves, and the one to which their properties are essentially due, is the oil.",
        "medicalProperties": "Unlike most spices, clove has an obvious medical value. It contains eugenol which is an effective local anesthetic, and this has long been used in dentistry. Other constituents include salicylic acid. Although the smoking of clove cigarettes is a national habit in Indonesia, the entry of this aromatic tobacco in the U.S.A. was curtailed when suspicion arose that it could cause adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Clove, which is an aphrodisiac (with properties similar to those of rhinoceros horn – i.e. an imaginary symbol of potency), was a highly valued flavor, a possible food preservative, and a pharmaceutical panacea in past centuries. Now, it is a rarely appreciated spice and an old-fashioned drug that has little role in medicine or dentistry today.",
        "historicalView": "Both cloves and the oil are stimulant, aromatic, and carminative. Cloves in substance or infusion are sometimes given to relieve nausea and vomiting, more especially the vomiting of pregnancy, to relieve flatulence, and to except weak digestion. The oil of cloves sometimes affords relief when introduced into the cavity of a carious tooth.",

The plant is indigenous to Greece, but the seed is now as well known in Asiatic and South American as it is in Mediterranean cooking. Cilantro is regarded as an herb, and is used with Mexican salsas, in Greek dishes and, along with the seeds of coriander, in Indian curries and in Thai food.

It is popular in Morocco in kabobs and couscous, in England in mulligatawny soup, in German sausages, pickles, cakes and breads, Dutch cheese, Mexican sauces and chili con carne, in hummus and in India’s masalas and curries. It is also used in liqueur, such as kummel, when alcohol is flavored with cumin, caraway, and fennel. Cumin and caraway are often confused with each other, and with anise, which is sometimes called sweet cumin. In the U.S.A., this spice is used in condiments, in flavors and in perfumes. Cumin is grown extensively in Iran, and is used in many Persian recipes. However, the Iranian spice, black cumin, and the similar spice, nigella, are less popular outside Iran, India and a few other countries, in which they are mostly used for flavoring rice dishes. ",
        "usefulParts": "The seeds are the source of the flavor. They may be used whole or more likely ground.",
        "medicalProperties": "Cumin resembles other similar old spices, having been advocated for many medical indications. There is no evidence that it has useful properties other than being a spicy flavor with digestive benefits. Nevertheless, it is being evaluated for possible anticancer and antioxidant effects.",
        "historicalView": "Cumin agrees with the other umbelliferous fruits in being mildly stimulant, aromatic, and carminative. It is, however, rarely or ever used internally in this country, or in the United States, for medicinal purposes, caraway being equally efficient and a much mor agreeable remedy. In India, however, cumin fruits are much valued as a carminative by the natives. As a discutient and resolvent, cumin is sometimes used externally in the form of the old official “Emplastrum Cumini” of the London Pharmacopoeia.",

        "introduction": "The Romans called this native Mediterranean plant foeniculum, meaning fragrant hay. It thus has a similar name to fenugreek, but the two are quite different. Fennel stalks and stems are used as a vegetable, while the stronger tasting fennel seeds have a flavor more like aniseed or licorice. In ancient Greece it was known as Marathon (because it grew at this battle site), and it was used as a symbol of victory. In Italy, fennel is called finocchio; it used to be regarded as an emblem of flattery, and it suggested foppishness or perhaps homosexuality.<br>In the past, fennel was regarded as an essential culinary spice and as being an herb with mystical properties. Legends suggested it was beneficial for eyesight, and it was subsequently used for gastrointestinal disorders and for coughs. In this respect, its use resembled that of anise and dill. Fennel stalks are becoming more popular in the U.S.A. as a vegetable or salad, but its European role in cooking is as a flavor for fish, bread and confectionary . In China, it is found in the well-known five-spice powder, along with Szechwan pepper, anise, clove and cinnamon. ",

        "introduction": "The herb Trigonella foenum-graecum, is a reminder that the Romans imported it from Greece as a desirable crop, “Greek hay”, that was used as a cattle food. However, the seed became a popular spice and has long been used as a nourishing dietary herb in the Middle East to which it is native, and in India and the Far East. It is more familiar in many countries as a component of curry powder, to which it contributes a curry-like taste. It is also used raw or roasted to give flavor to mango chutney and to imitation maple syrup and to some artificial licorice preparations. Other constituents impart a strong celery-like odor, and they are utilized in the fragrance industry.<br>It is used as an appetizer, a tonic and an aphrodisiac, and it is included in many foods and beverages. Fenugreek has a long history of dubious indications, including fevers, colic, flatulence, dyspepsia, dysentery, cough, tuberculosis, edema, rickets, leg ulcers, gout, diabetes and baldness. There is little evidence to suggest the spice is toxic or that it has significant anticoagulant or hormonal effects.",
        "usefulParts": "The seeds of fenugreek are the source of the spice, but the sprouts may be eaten raw in salads.",
        "medicalProperties": "The seed is a source of the steroidal saponin diosgenin, which can be used to manufacture many pharmaceuticals, such as progesterone. The chemical trigonelline is converted into niacin when the seed is roasted. The seeds also provide a mucilaginous fiber content that may benefit the bowel. Of more current interest is the evidence that fenugreek has a minor hypoglycemic effect, thus suggesting it may, in fact, help with diabetes. There is also some evidence that it can reduce hypercholesterolemia in animals.",
        "historicalView": "The use of fenugreek as a medicinal agent is now obsolete in Europe and the United States; but in India the seeds are largely employed by the natives, both as food and medicine, while the fresh plant is consumed as a vegetable. In Alexandria also the seedlings are eaten as a great delicacy. Formerly the seeds were employed in the preparation of emollient cataplasms, fomentations, and enemata; but were never given internally.",

        "introduction": "Garlic is the name given to the leek (herb) with gar (spear) shaped leaves. Its Latin name Allium sativum is derived from al = burning, sativum = harvested. The plant may have arisen as a wild variant (“ramson”) in Siberia, but it has spread world-wide, and is harvested in China, India, Gilroy in California, and in many other places. As a food, it was favored by the Hebrews in biblical Egypt, and it is now beloved in both homespun and gourmet cooking everywhere. Garlic has had a long-held reputation as a medicine, and it was regarded by the popular 17th century British herbalist, Culpeper, as the “poor man’s treacle”, implying that it had value as an antidote to poisons and as a panacea for illnesses. Chicago is named after the Indian term for the place where the wild garlic grows.<br>Garlic is so widely grown that it cannot be regarded as an exotic plant. Nevertheless, it is generally thought of as a spice because of its remarkable pungent aroma, and its value for culinary and medical uses. William Harvey published his revolutionary book on the Motion of the Blood in 1628; he was impressed with an issue that still remains a concern: the presence of garlic’s smell on the breath following its consumption. However, Harvey was more impressed that a folk remedy for colds called for garlic in the shoe: the fact that this therapy led to the smell of garlic on the breath was noted by him as additional evidence that the blood circulates in the body. The other well-known connection between garlic and blood was the herb’s traditional property of repelling vampires.",
        "usefulParts": "The bulb’s small cloves contain the active ingredient used in cooking and for medicinal purposes.",
        "medicalProperties": "The smell of garlic is caused by allicin (diallyldisulfide-S-oxide), which is derived from precursors such as alliin (S-allyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide) by the enzyme alliinase which is liberated when the clove is broken up. The active compound resembles the well known drug N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst), which has mucolytic and antioxidant properties.<br>Garlic contains several potent antioxidants, and there is evidence that its addition to the diet may help reduce the incidence of gastric and colorectal cancers.<br>The chemicals in garlic can help reduce serum cholesterol, hypertension, blood clotting, blood sugar, bowel parasites, respiratory and other infections, and the aging process itself. However, additional clinical evidence is still needed to determine whether its widespread popularity as an herbal medicine can be justified by measurable benefits of significance.<br>There is insufficient information to suggest that any specific proprietary or home preparation is more effective than either simple raw or cooked garlic.<br>The taste of garlic is acceptable to many animals, and our eating of garlic has not been proved to deflect the attention of mosquitoes, vampires or wolves.<br>Garlic festivals and specialty restaurants have demonstrated that this unique spice can be appreciated as a delectable flavor in almost any prepared food, including ice cream.",
        "historicalView": "As a medicine garlic was held in great repute by the ancient physicians, and was also formerly much used in modern practice, but in this country is now rarely used by the regular practitioner, although it is still employed to some extent in the United States. Garlic is stimulant, diaphoretic, expectorant, diuretic, and tonic, when exhibited internally; and rubefacient when applied externally…",

        "introduction": "One of the most popular of the hot-tasting spices is ginger, which is obtained from the root of Zingiber officinale. The plant is indigenous to southern China, from whence it is spread to the Spice Islands and other parts of Asia, and subsequently to West Africa and to the Caribbean. India is now the main producer and exporter. Extracts of ginger are used in foods, condiments, baked confections, candies, beverages, cosmetics and perfumes. It is common to find it in many supermarkets for use in food preparation or as an herbal medicine. China produces a ginger which is particularly suited for confectionery, whereas Japanese ginger lacks the typical aroma. Pickled ginger (gari or sushoga) is always used as a condiment for sushi. Overall, ginger products vary considerably in taste, pungency and smell, while the root varies in consistency, depending on the country of origin and the variety of the crop.",
        "usefulParts": "The rhizome contains the spicy parts.",
        "medicalProperties": "The main constituents in ginger are phenolic compounds such as gingerols and shogaols, and sesquiterpenes such as zingiberene. These and other compounds are extracts found in ginger oleoresin. The main pungent flavor chemicals are the gingerols, which are not volatile. Recently, studies have suggested it is of value as an anti-emetic; however, it should probably not be used in nausea of pregnancy, since its safety has not been established. There is less convincing evidence to support claims that ginger is an antioxidant, with cancer preventing properties, or that it has anti-inflammatory benefits in arthritis. In large amounts, it appears to inhibit platelet aggregation.",
        "historicalView": "Traditionally, the warming and aromatic properties of ginger led to its use for numerous indications. It is a digestant and carminative, and was used for dyspepsia and bowel colic. It is a general stimulant, being one of many spices that are regarded as being aphrodisiacs. Ginger has been recommended as an expectorant and it is traditionally used in teas or soups to treat colds or bronchitis. Many traditional Chinese medicines contain ginger, and its use generally appears to be safe.<br>Ginger possesses stimulant, aromatic, and carminative properties, when taken internally; and when chewed it acts as a sialogogue. Externally applied it is rubefacient. The stimulating, aromatic, and carminative properties render it of much value in atonic dyspepsia, especially if accompanied with much flatulence; and as an adjunct to purgative medicines to correct griping.",

        "introduction": "The word horseradish is derived from the German word for “sea radish”, since it grows in coastal areas in Europe. Although horseradish (Amorica rusticana) does not fulfill the criteria of being an aromatic or exotic herb for use in cooking, it can be classified along with mustard, garlic and onion as a pungent condiment. However, despite its popularity for garnishing meat dishes, and some forms of prepared fish, it is rarely incorporated as a basic flavor component in any cooked dish. In distinction to mustard, it has not been regarded as having an affinity for being combined with wine, although it was formerly used as a “pick-me-up” in beer. The origin of horseradish may have been Russia, but it has spread widely; in the U.S.A. it was formerly grown mainly in the Midwest, but now about 40% of the country’s supply comes from around Tule Lake in northern California.<br>The related wasabi, which has a fiery taste comparable to horseradish mixed with mustard, originated in Japan; much is now grown in New Zealand and in Oregon. The spice continues to be used mainly as an accompanying condiment for sashimi and sushi, or as a snack flavor. It is common experience that oral intake of wasabi or horseradish constitutes the best therapy for sinusitis and nasal congestion.<br>The common radish is still regarded as a pungent salad vegetable rather than a spice. It is of interest that radish seedlings contain S-carboxymethyl-cysteine, which is marketed as a synthetic mucolytic in Europe. Allyl isothiocyanate (“allyl mustard oil”) is the major chemical produced by horseradish and mustard; several other related sulfur compounds contribute to the pungent taste and initiating odor. These chemicals are very toxic when used in large amounts.<br>Ground-up horseradish can be added to a glass of water sweetened with honey; this suspension can be used as a gargle to improve mucus clearance. Radish seedlings were used in ancient times for asthma, and any benefit presumably results from its effect on mucus. Ground-up horseradish can be used on a poultice to serve as a rubefacient and a topical counter-irritant in comparable manner to a mustard plaster. Most people today, however, are only able to appreciate the stimulating and activating effects as the \"therapeutic\" outcome of a stiff dose of the horseradish type of spices.",
        "usefulParts": "The root is the source of horseradish; the leaves are sometimes used in salads.",
        "medicalProperties": "The medical use of horseradish and wasabi includes the treatment of sinus, throat and lung problems, since pungent spices loosen up impacted mucus. Horseradish has also been described as a diuretic and is used as a source of Vitamin C. Its value as an antihelminth and for treating infections has never been proved.",
        "historicalView": "It has the same properties as mustard, being stimulant, diuretic, and diaphoretic, when given internally; and rubefacient or even vesicant, when externally applied.",

        "introduction": "The taste of licorice is similar to that of aniseed and fennel, and thus licorice can be considered to be a spice. However, it has a long history as being of value as an herbal remedy, and it is therefore often considered to be an herb rather than a spice. The licorice plant is a member of the bean family, but its seed pods are hair free in contrast to similar plants. Its roots contain the very sweet, characteristic juice, and as a tribute to this, the plant is named Glycyrrhiza glabra – meaning the sweet root with hairless seed pods. Corruption of the Greek name glyrrhiza led to the other official name, Liquiritra officinalis; the medieval name was gliquiricia from which the name licorice or liquorice is obtained. The sweetest sources of licorice come from plants growing in Spain and Italy, although it is probable that the original plant came from Russia or China. Spanish licorice was brought to England, and it became an important product in the town of Pontefract.<br>The pleasant quality of true licorice led to it being incorporated into many traditional Chinese remedies, where it was credited with harmonizing the body’s response when it was exposed to the contrasting actions of other herbs in the formula. It has also been utilized in Chinese spice mixtures, and is often incorporated in desserts, confectionaries, candies and alcoholic drinks. Further uses include its addition to tobaccos and snuff. Currently, it is included in many simple medications, especially for pharyngitis and cough. Traditionally, the list of indications is very extensive, and includes infections, aphthous ulcers, skin disorders, rheumatic and other inflammatory diseases, asthma, hepatic and gastroduodenal diseases.<br>There is no doubt that glycyrrhizin has an aldosterone like effect, and excessive intake of licorice can cause hypokalemia and hypertension. However, the claimed value of licorice products in treating hypo-adrenal states is disputed. Other hormonal effects have been suggested, including impairment of gonadal function.<br>Thus, this ancient herbal spice has dubious medical values that are complemented by its undoubted toxic potential. It may surprise many people in the U.S. to know that familiar licorice candy is usually not true licorice, since the flavor is generally provided by aniseed, molasses and corn syrup. Eaters of typical U.S. licorice products may put on weight, but this will not be explainable by the hormonal effects of the compounds found in true licorice. ",
        "usefulParts": "The roots and rhizomes are the important source for the flavor",
        "medicalProperties": "Licorice contains several active phytomedicines. The main one is the saponin-like triterpene glycoside, glycyrrhizin (also called glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhizinic acid), which is much sweeter than sugar. This compound is hydrolyzed in the bowel to glycyrrhetic (or glycyrrhetinic) acid, which is also called enoxolone. The latter has been marketed as a succinate derivative, carbenoxolone, which is prescribed in Europe and Japan as a treatment for gastric ulcers, although its value is uncertain. Licorice flavonoids are believed to have antioxidant properties. Additional effects of glycyrrhizin include the surprising finding in Japan that this agents helps improve liver function in hepatitis C. Similarly, some reports demonstrate improvement in AIDS. All such studies raise unanswered questions as to the true value of licorice in the modern era.",

        "introduction": "Over 4000 years ago, mustard seeds were being utilized in Greece and Egypt as a flavor and a medicine. The mustards are part of the cabbage family. Brassica (or Sinapsis) alba is white or yellow mustard; other species are known as brown mustard, and the main variety was formerly called black or true mustard. The brown cultivar is more pungent, and is used in the popular Dijon mustard; the milder American or English mustards are often made more colorful by the addition of the yellow dye, turmeric. The most pungent mustard taste is obtained from freshly ground seeds, but numerous other gustatory components are added to commercial condiments, including various spices, herbs and alcohol.<br>Despite its ability to be grown worldwide, mustard can be regarded as a spice. It arose in the Mediterranean countries, but its “exotic” taste led to it being transplanted to India and other Asian countries in medieval times and it was imported into the Americas by Spanish missionaries. In California, wild mustard is now a common weed whose yellow flowers can be seen widely beyond the trails to missions alongside which they were first planted. Mustard seeds develop no odor when crushed, but the pungent taste is more relevant than its odor. The name mustard comes from the product that was derived by adding sinapsis (the Roman name for mustard seed) to unfermented grape juice, or “must”. This resulted in a “hot must” or mustard; the latter part of the word comes from the Latin, “ardere”, which means “to burn”. In Sweden, the old Latin name is recalled by the current name for mustard, senap; in Italian it is called senape. ",
        "usefulParts": "The seeds are either used whole or ground into a powder. The leaves may be used in salads.",
        "medicalProperties": "The pungent and irritating allyl isothiocyanate (“mustard gas”) that is released from brown mustard, horseradish and other pungent vegetables, has been used in war gas products and other offensive preparations both for attack and for personal defense. Derivatives, such as nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine) have been used as antineoplastic drugs. The plant source of the active chemicals is sinigrin (or allylglucosinolate, which is also known as potassium myrosinate); crushing the brown mustard seed releases the enzyme myrosinase, which converts the sinigrin to allylisothiocyanate and related compounds that have irritating, lachrymatory properties.",
        "historicalView": "Similar to, but milder than, those of black mustard seeds. When swallowed whole they operate as a laxative, and have been used as a remedy in dyspepsia, and in other complaints attended with torpidity of the bowels. But their use in this state is by no means free from danger, as they sometimes accumulate in the intestines, and have produced fatal effects.",

        "introduction": "The quintessential spice is nutmeg: it was a highly valued exotic flavor source that grew only in the remote Spice Islands. It is not generally known that nutmeg is the kernel of the apricot-like fruit of the tree, Myristica fragrans, and that it is enclosed in a hard seed-case covered with an arillus; this soft membranous coat is the spice, mace. It is astounding to learn how popular these two spices were in the 15th-17th centuries, especially when compared to how little they are appreciated today.<br>Nutmeg may have been a rare delicacy in ancient Greece and Rome, although there is little evidence of its use in the food or drink of those times. Nutmeg became more familiar to Byzantine traders who obtained it from Arabs, and its name may be derived from the Arabic word “mesk”, which is related to the word musky, meaning fragrant. In old French, “mug” meant musk, and the French term for the musk-nut, noix muguette, became the English word nutmeg. Mace may have had a similar etymologic derivation.<br>The availability of the nutmeg in Europe increased once Crusaders learned to appreciate it in Middle Eastern cooking, and Venetian spice traders then ensured that it became familiar to banqueters of the 12th century. It was generally imported with its companion from the Spice Islands, the aromatic clove.<br>The exaggerated desire for nutmeg, mace and clove by the 15th century made the Moluccan Islands a major target of Portugese explorers. In 1512 an expedition was sent by Albuquerque, the commander of the Portugese fleet in the strategic port of Malacca in the Malay peninsula, to locate the fabled Spice Islands. The commander of two boats, Francisco Serrâo, was the first European to gather nutmegs and cloves from their original source in a select few of the thousand or so of islands in the Moluccan sea. Nutmeg grew mainly on two of the seven Banda Islands in the southeast Moluccas, while cloves were found particularly in Ternate and Timore.<br>As an outcome of their fateful discovery, the Moluccan Islands remained under Portugese control until these colonials were ousted by the Dutch in the first quarter of the 17th century. The Dutch policy of harsh monopolistic source control resulted in nutmeg trees being destroyed on all islands other than the precious plantations of Banda and Ambon. The Dutch were eventually replaced by the British for a few years at the end of the 18th century, but by that time the Spice Islands had yielded their unique spice trees to Mauritius (controlled by the French), Malaya and the West Indies. Eventually, the Caribbean island of Grenada became an important source of cultivated nutmeg trees.<br>The taste for nutmeg and mace has varied over the millennia. Although long used as a food flavor in Asia, these spices were mainly appreciated for adding to alcoholic drinks in ancient Rome. In medieval and renaissance banquets, exotic spices, including mace and nutmeg, along with the popular cinnamon, were added in large amounts to various dishes. Fashionable French gourmets would bring their own nutmeg graters to add their nutmeg to appropriately improve on a wealthy host’s dinner. Such affectations generally disappeared in the 18th century, when attention was shifted to the newly fashionable coffee, chocolate and tobacco. Currently, the Dutch maintain a liking for nutmeg and mace, whereas in the cuisines of most other European and American countries, these flavors have a minor role. Perhaps European nutmeg, which comes from the Moluccan Islands, is of better quality than U.S. nutmegs that are grown in Grenada. Furthermore, ground nutmeg and pulverized mace rapidly lose their volatile oleoresins, and thus only freshly ground specimens are of major gustatory value.<br>Nutmeg is mostly used in cola drinks, in confectionary and holiday dishes, such as eggnog. However, the more aromatic mace is characteristically used in making sausages and other prepared meats, and in donuts, where it provides a recognizable flavor. The former magical and panacea-like properties have declined, and neither spice is utilized in medical practice today.",
        "usefulParts": "The dried seed is used for nutmeg and its dried covering (aril) produces mace.",
        "medicalProperties": "Large amounts of nutmeg can provide atropine-like hallucinatory experiences, and it has been reported that this agent enjoyed a reputation as a recreational stimulant in some U.S. prisons. It is likely that the active agent is myristicin. This compound is also present in parsley, dill and star anisè, but in very small amounts. Interestingly, the Czech physiologist who studied vision, Purkinje, reported on his own experiences of nutmeg-induced hallucinations. Some may feel that the prior exalted role of nutmeg and spice in the culinary repertoire represents a mass hallucinatory response to modish fashions.",
        "historicalView": "Nutmeg [and mace] possess like the other spices, aromatic, stimulant, and carminative properties; but in large doses it is narcotic, producing effects, it is said, similar to those of camphor. It has been used with advantage in mild cases of diarrhea, flatulent colic, and certain forms of dyspepsia…",

        "introduction": "The onion probably originated in East Asia, but has spread around the world and has developed numerous varieties, including shallot, chive, and scallion. The name may come from onion’s “union” or singleness as a bulb. The plant is related to the lily botanically; chemically it is a less piquant cousin of garlic in taste, but it is unique in its lachrymatory properties. It is said to be the basis for the name of Chicago, which comes from an Indian phrase meaning “The place where the wild onion (or garlic) grows”. Currently, it is the most popular herb, since it is nutritionally satisfying in addition to being flavorful; people, such as the Hebrews who made their exodus from Egypt 3000 years ago, have long favored it as a basic food. Homeopaths use a dilute extract as a treatment for colds, but most other medical systems use it in a non-specific fashion as a warm, invigorating and satisfying tonic herb. It is sometimes used topically to treat insect stings, but personal experience suggests it lacks any significant anti-allergy properties. It has mild anti-microbial qualities and has been used in wound treatment.",

        "historicalView": "The onion is chiefly cultivated for culinary purposes. The bulbs afford a considerable proportion of alimentary matter, principally mucilage, particularly when boiled; but in dyspeptic habits they occasion flatulence, thirst, and headache. The bulb is the most active part and is stimulant, diuretic, and expectorant. On account of the free phosphoric acid it contains, the juice is supposed to be useful in calculous cases, as it dissolves phosphate of lime out of the body.",

The sour fruit pulp contains tartaric acid; its taste goes well with meat and vegetable dishes, and it is used in marinades, vindaloos, curries, chutneys and Worcestershire sauce. It is also used in drinks and in refreshing confectionary preparations. Increasingly, it is used in such Mexican drinks as aguas, dulces de tamarindo and colas. Some products, such as tamarind lollipops, have been the subject of FDA alerts because of their containing lead or insect contaminants. In Indian traditional medicine, tamarind had many indications, including its use as a digestive, laxative, tonic, antihelminthic, antipyretic, and astringent.
